# Scikit_Learn_Integration

I plan to go through the codes for all the Gensim's models to decide what classes, functions etc. would be useful while implementation of the wrappers for integration of Gensim with scikit-learn. Hence, this would help me get familiar with the relevant codebase. Also, this repository could serve as a blueprint at the time of actual implementation of the model wrappers.
